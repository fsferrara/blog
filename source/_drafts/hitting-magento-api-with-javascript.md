On the Internet, there are very few posts about how to use Magento APIs with Javascript.
Magento is an open-source content management system for e-commerce websites, and in my opinion, it is a good choice for those who do serious e-commerce business. It, besides being a Web CMS, exposes several APIs that enable us to build other websites and applications (such as iOS or Android app) that use Magento features.
An example of such application is Magento-on-Angular which is a mini-shopping application written with javascript and angularjs (client-side) and PHP and laravel (server-side). In fact, Wildhoney built a new server-side layer that communicates with Magento using its API. We can find a lot of PHP examples that use Magento API; also the official documentation is using PHP to make examples.
