I still remember when I joined the Hotels.com technology team and how excited I was to start such a new challenge. Since the very early days, I noticed that working in a global company is quite different from working in the same building. That is obvious, I know, but it wasn’t easy to get used to the new way of working.

I missed getting in touch with new teammates, and sometimes felt isolated from others and had the feeling of being a *remote worker*. Later on, only when I started working from home for 2 days per week, I realized that working in a *global team* has a lot in common with the *remote work*.

In this story, I will list __my personal seven rules__ that allowed me to collaborate effectively with colleagues scattered across the world.

The slides deck is available for download.
