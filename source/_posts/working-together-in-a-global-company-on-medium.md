I still remember when I joined the Hotels.com™ (part of Expedia Group™) technology team and how excited I was to start such a new challenge. Since the very early days, I noticed that working in a global company is quite different from working in the same building. That is obvious, I know, but it wasn’t easy to get used to the new way of working.

I missed getting in touch with new teammates, and sometimes felt isolated from others and had the feeling of being a *remote worker*. Later on, only when I started working from home for 2 days per week, I realized that working in a *global team* has a lot in common with the *remote work*.

[The story available on Medium](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/working-together-in-a-global-company-d242cee6f440?source=friends_link&sk=e16f366ae77168ab10a6e660c2995e82) tells my journey, from working in the same room with my team to collaborating effectively in a global company. I have always been interested in remote work and I have collected for you _my 7 tips_ that can help those who start working in a global workforce.
