# My Blog Source

Here is my blog source.
Previously I was using [Octopress](https://github.com/fsferrara/octopress-blog), then I switched to *Hexo*.

## Tools

To run this blog, you'll need the following tools:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) with npm
* [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)

## Installation

The blog code is generated by Hexo (yes, it's a static site generator).
So, the procedure is like: get the hexo blog source locally, generate the static blog (or site), and then deploy the generated files.

### Cloning the blog sources

This repository contains the blog sources. Clone with:

```
git clone git@github.com:fsferrara/blog.git
cd blog
```
*Be carefull, you need to clone the theme as well!*

Clone the [theme](https://github.com/fsferrara/hexo-theme-next):

```
git clone git@github.com-fsferrara:fsferrara/hexo-theme-next.git themes/next
```

### Installing Hexo

To install Hexo just type `npm install hexo-cli -g`, and then you'll have the hexo cli.
In alternative, you can run `npm install` and add `./node_modules/.bin` to your `PATH` to use the local executable.

## Deploy to github pages

The deploy instructions are located in the `_config.yml`.
In order to deploy to github pages, I have this configuration:

```
deploy:
  type: git
  repo: https://github.com/fsferrara/fsferrara.github.io.git
  branch: master
```

where `https://github.com/fsferrara/fsferrara.github.io.git` is the repository behind [my blog](https://fsferrara.github.io/).

To issue a deploy use: 

```
nvm use
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
