# My Blog Source

Here is my blog source.
Previously I was using [Octopress](https://github.com/fsferrara/octopress-blog), then I switched to *Hexo*.

## Tools

To run this blog, you'll need the following tools:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) with npm
* [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)

## Installation

The blog code is generated by Hexo (yes, it's a static site generator).
So, the procedure is like: get the hexo blog source locally, generate the static blog (or site), and then deploy the generated files.

### Cloning the blog sources

This repository contains the blog sources.
*Be carefull, it contains a submodule!*
Remember to clone with:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:fsferrara/blog.git
```

At the moment, the only submodules is the [theme](https://github.com/fsferrara/cactus-dark). It's a submodule since I [forked](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus) it from a [guy](https://github.com/probberechts).
